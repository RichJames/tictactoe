TO DO:

- I've introduced a bug in the computer move logic. Fix that.
- Set up automated unit testing
- Change saved games approach to use order of moves (e.g. 13526 - cell 1, then 3, then 5... First one is always X. Odds are X, evens are O)
- Have AI avoid making losing moves
- Run tidy-clang again and fix issues found
- Run cppcheck against code.
- Build a web front-end
- Redo database interface via RESTful API
- Take in command line arguments to flag for tests, normal run, etc.
- Set up and test interacting with a Postgres database.
- Add debug and release build switches to makefile
- Consider if refactoring to use a design pattern is warranted
